# Info
a random ass "ransomware" I made in py awhile ago because I was bored.

# How to use
common sense just run it (DONT RUN MORE THEN ONCE) then after your files have been encrypted open decrypt.py
and type in **ilikepenis15** then all your files in the current dir will be restored to their original state.

# idc
do whatever you want with this if you want skid it go for it.
